## 🛠️ Git Version Control Evolution

### The Evolution of Version Control

```
Local VCS (RCS)     →     Centralized VCS (SVN)     →     Distributed VCS (Git)
    📁                         🖥️                           🌐
Single machine             Single server               Distributed network
```

1. **Local Version Control**
   - Better than file timestamps
   - Single point of failure: your machine
   
2. **Centralized Version Control** 
   - Team collaboration possible
   - Single point of failure: the server
   
3. **Distributed Version Control (Git)**
   - Fully fault tolerant
   - Everyone has complete history
   - Offline capabilities

### Git's Core Design Goals

✅ **Speed** - Fast operations, even on large projects  
✅ **Simple Design** - Elegant and understandable architecture  
✅ **Non-Linear Development** - Thousands of parallel branches  
✅ **Fully Distributed** - No single point of failure  
✅ **Large Project Capable** - Handle projects like the Linux kernel
